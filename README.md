## About this seed

This seed is the result of improving an assigment for __UTN FRBA__, Systems Design Course where it consist of developing a simple web application using an MVC pattern with `Spark Java` and `JPA`. Having [`Bootstrap 5`](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and `HandleBars` for front-end developing.
<br></br>
The seed provides a minimal set up to arrage your project so you can create a web application with minimal effort.
<br></br>
If you are developing the System Design assignment I highly recommend taking a look at this seed, it will provide a good inspiration and stating point.
